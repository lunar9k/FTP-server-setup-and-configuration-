## Configuration Firewall 
We have to configure firewall for security purpose , we have to open ports of server which use 20 & 21
for this we use UFW firewall in linux

* first we have to enable firewall
  we use this command `sudo ufw enable`
  ```
  sudo ufw allow 20/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 990/tcp
  sudo ufw allow 5000:10000/tcp
  ```
  for allow ports from firewall

## Configure users
we have to create users for specific purpose

- We have to host public Ftp server to download file
- We want to upload files to linux server for personal use and we would not have public user

* In first case we need to create an additional user and share its username and password with clients to access the files

use `sudo adduser ftpuser`for add user in server

For security , we disable ssh permission for this user we have to configure this
for this we use `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd-config` add `Denyusers ftpuser` and save it
